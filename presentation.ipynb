    "## Discussion\n",
    "I found the article very interesting and precise. All the data involved were presented in detail and the problem was clearly explained. \n",
    "However, I personally would have done something differently: \n",
    "- in the [regional level analysis](code/aim1.ipynb) I think that fitting a linear model is quite useless. It is clear from the beginning that it could not be a good model because there are just 7 observations.\n",
    "- in the [subregional level analysis](code/aim2.ipynb) only univariate model are considered. I would have analysed a complete model with all the pollutants together. In this way, we could have seen the effect of single pollutants keeping constant the others.  \n",
    "- Pollutants used in the two different levels are not the sames. I would have included also in the regional level models pm10 and pm25.\n",
    "- Solfure dioxide, which turns out to be significant in some subregional analysis, is not even mentioned in the article. I would have included it in all the models.\n",
    "- Performing the analysis in three different levels is in some ways confusing in my opinion. Results are different for different levels and this makes difficult to have a unique and final interpretation. The ozone, as example, is a protective factor for the expected number of deaths at regional and subregional level and for the COVID-19 cases at subregional level but is not significant for the expected number of cases at regional level. I have not performed the individual level analysis but in the articole is mentioned that ozone is not significant at that level.\n",
    "- The negative and significant sign of ozone is explained in the article by saying that \"the negative association between ozone levels and COVID-19 infection and mortality may be attribuite to reduced nitrogen oxide conversion to ozone in urban areas\". I think that if ozone and nitrogen oxide are associated they should be analysed in the same multivariate model. \n",
    "- The last problem I had was related to the creation of [covid_air_dt dataset](\"code/Air_poll_assignment.ipynb\"). Although I have used th author's python code, I get slightly different results in the average 10 nearest pollutants values. "
